# Business-Process-Modelling
The Business Process Model (BPM) for a case study, Bagsbycanny.

A brief explanation of what BPM is; Business process modelling is the activity of representing processes of an enterprise, so that the current business processes may be analyzed, improved, and automated. The goal of this project was to develop a process map of how the mobile app will flow.

One of the key importance of a business analyst is to help improve the operations of a business. After creating a mind map to highlight some of her business problems, it was identified that the order and purchase process needed to be improved as the previous process was slow and led to the loss of customers.

I created the BPM using the Bizagi modeller, a software for business process automation on a low-code development platform. The order process developed is to be carried out in two stages; the Account creation for the bagsbycanny app and the order placement. The process would be executed by three parties; the first-time buyers, existing customers and the purchasing department which is in charge of handling, processing and dispatching of orders.

From the attached link, you would notice how the order process flows. starting with the Home section of the proposed app, to the browse categories section, to the account set-up section, to adding items to the cart and placing orders, to the purchase/sales department in charge of processing and dispatch of orders.

This newly developed process would help the business in retaining customers' information as agreed by the customers, which in turn would increase the retention rate for the business.
